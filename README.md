# ausy-banner

*Welcome to the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io) project for the AUSY ASCII banner 
challenge!*

This tiny Spring Boot application does nothing but printing the AUSY banner during the 
start-up on `System.out`

            _   _   _ ______   __
           / \ | | | / ___\ \ / /
          / _ \| | | \___ \\ V / 
         / ___ \ |_| |___) || |  
        /_/   \_\___/|____/ |_|  
    <== IT ALL STARTS WITH MONEY ==>

As one can see, this output contains an **error** (replace *MONEY* with *PEOPLE*).

The challenge is to correct this wrong output. The code is to be found in `BannerBean.java`

Have a lot of fun!
